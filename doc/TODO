TODO:
Creating new Detectors: We need a way for a detector to create config UI for the client. A Detector's configuration is an array of Strings (easy to serialize).
Adding new Detectors: The service needs to persist the detectors (and their configurations) added to it, so that it can restore them when it restarts.
We'll also need to persist LocationInstance objects and their events.
